    "content": "ARCADE is a flexible, extensible, interface-based Java framework for agent-based modeling of biological systems. Get the latest release on GitHub . ARCADE is a lightweight agent-based modeling framework that uses the MASON library for multi-agent scheduling and simulation. Existing implementations of the core interfaces can be used to run simulations via highly configurable setup files. ARCADE currently has two major implementation: . | patch represents one or more agents in each environmental patch location | potts represents agents as a collection of connected voxels (Cellular Potts modeling) | . New implementations of these interfaces can be easily integrated with existing functionality to develop models for different biological systems or questions of interest. The ARCADE v3 patch implementation is actively under development and not yet at parity with ARCADE v2. You can track progress using the migration: v2 to v3 tag. ",
